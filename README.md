## About
This utility extracts email addresses and order numbers from all PDF files in a specified directory using Python. It simply prints the email addresses and order numbers after running. For those that actively work on contracts, orders, commitments, and more, this may be a helpful utility to find all names/emails associated within specific PDF's, or an entire directory of them.
